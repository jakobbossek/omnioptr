## Introduction

Simple interface to the C-implementation of the Omni-optimizer by Deb and Tiwari (1,2). The algorithm "is designed as a generic
multi-objective, multi-optima optimizer" (2).

for single and multi-objective optimization*. European Journal of Operations
Research 185(3): 1062-1087.

Multi-objective Optimization*. In: Proceedings of the Evolutionary Multi-Criterion
Conference (EMO) 2005: 47-61.s


## Example

```r
library(omnioptr)
library(smoof)

# Single-Objective Example (see reference (2), Section 4.2)
# ===

set.seed(1) # reproducibility
fn = smoof::makeHimmelblauFunction()
res = omniopt(fn, 100, 200, var.space.niching = TRUE, delta = 0.001,
  verbose = FALSE envir = environment())

# final points in decision space
plot(fn)
points(t(res$dec))

# visualization of progress
for (i in 1:length(res$history)) {
  e = res$history[[i]]
  if (is.null(e))
    next
  plot(fn, main = sprintf("Iteration %i", i))
  points(t(e$dec))
  Sys.sleep(0.1)
}

# Multi-Objective Example
# ===

set.seed(1) # reproducibility
fn = smoof::makeZDT2Function(dimension = 4L)
res = omniopt(fn, 100, 1000, p.cross = 0.9, verbose = FALSE)
plot(t(res$obj))
pairs(t(res$dec))
```

## Installation Instructions

The package will be available at [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org) *when it is done*. If you are interested in trying out and playing around with the current github developer version use the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package and type the following command in R:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("jakobbossek/omnioptr")
```

## Getting help

Please address questions and missing features about the *omnioptr* as weell as annoying bug reports in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jakobbossek/omnioptr/issues). Pay attention to explain your problem as good as possible. At its best you provide an example, so I can reproduce your problem quickly. Please avoid sending e-mails.
